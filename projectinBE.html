					<h3 class="mywelllv1aa">LITERATURE SUMMARY</h3>
					<p class="text-justify mywelllvlaa1"><span>Filters</span> are almost used in all devices in Digital Signal Processing as they extract useful part from input signal. FIR filter impulse response is of finite duration. Impulse response of order FIR filter has N+1 samples  before it settles to 0. FIR filters are inherently pipelined and Multiplication Constant Multiplications(MCM). By using Multi Bit Flip Flops the Area Delay Product(ADP), Energy Per Sample (EPS) are reduced. To further decrease ADP,  PDP, EPS few challenges are present. By using Lifting DWT the performance of FIR filter is improved.</p>
					<h3 class="mywelllv1aa">PROBLEM DEFINITION</h3>
					<p class="text-justify mywelllvlaa1"><span>To </span>reduce the Area Delay Product (ADP), Energy per sample (EPS) and decrease time delay by reducing flip flops using Lifting DWT.</p>
					<h3 class="mywelllv1aa">EXISTING SYSTEM</h3>
					<figure><img class="mywelllv1dd" src="images/resume4.png"></figure>
					<h3 class="mywelllv1aa3">Proposed system</h3>
					<p class="text-justify mywelllv1aa2"><span>The </span>VLSI architectures for lifting schemes is presented in terms of speed and hardware requirements. The whole architecture is being optimized to achieve better speed up and higher hardware utilization by using a single clock for predict and update operation. The data flow of the proposed architecture is regular, simple, control complexity and achieves 100% hardware utilization.</p>
					<p class="text-justify mywelllv1aa2"><span>The </span>Transpose form finite-impulse response (FIR) filters are inherently pipelined and support multiple constant multiplications (MCM) technique that results in significant saving of computation. The adders are reduced with MCM technique. Because of this area delay product(ADP), and energy per sample(EPS), are reduced. The number of multiplications and additions required for each filter increases filter order.</p>

					<h3 class="mywelllv1aa">CONCLUSION</h3>
					<p class="text-justify mywelllvlaa1"><span>The</span>proposed technique in the design of FIR filter, gives better response in terms of speed and count of flip flops in comparison to the MCM and Lifting DWT. We have achieved a design of a FIR filter using a Lifting Discrete Wavelet Transform which is faster by 22.1% and has reduced the delay of the FIR filter. Since our objective was to reduce the count of Flip Flops used in existing methodology of FIR filter, thus reduced by 8 flipflops than the existing methodology and the delay was also reduced, hence we achieved our objective. So, we practically saw that the Lifting DWT is much more efficient than existing methodology.</p>
